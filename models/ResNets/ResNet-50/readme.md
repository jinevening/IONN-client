ResNet models are described in the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).

They were used in [ILSVRC] (http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/) and COCO 2015 competitions, which won the 1st places in: ImageNet classification, ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.
